# StudApp_Design

This repository was initially created for the project for subject UI/UX Design.

The project itself is a design for the Uninet System (WSP) application.
The Uninet System, or WSP, is a educational system for KBTU students.
Using it they can get necessary for them information about all their subjects or professors.

This design was created to update current design of the Uninet System.
The design is not completed. Right now it is in the stage of draft.

Creator: Ilyas Rashitov.
